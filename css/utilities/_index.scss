/// # Utilities
///
/// Utilities are _non-semantic_ classes that can be used to apply _presentational_
/// styling regardless of any semantic context.
///
/// ## First Things First: Utility-Last
///
/// Stylament follows the [official recommendations][whatwg] on using the HTML
/// `class` attribute:
///
/// > […] authors are encouraged to use values that describe the nature of the content,
/// > rather than values that describe the desired presentation of the content.
///
/// With that in mind it is obvious that utility classes should only be used as last
/// resort when an elements needs a certain presentational trait without recognizable
/// semantic reason.
///
/// [whatwg]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#classes:~:text=authors%20are%20encouraged,presentation%20of%20the%20content
///
/// ## Kinds of Utility Classes
///
/// Unlike popular utility-first frameworks this is not limited to
/// [atomic utilities](ut-atomic.html) but also includes complex classes like
/// [layout utilities](ut-layout.html). Using semantics as 	differentiating factor
/// helps to draw a clear line between utility and [object](ob-intro.html) classes.
