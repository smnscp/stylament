/// # Objects
///
/// Objects are _semantic_ classes that extend/specify the meaning of the elements
/// they are applied to.
///
/// ## `class` – Just as Intended
///
/// The term of CSS objects was coined in [OOCSS][oocss]. Despite all the detailed ideas
/// behind OOCSS, essentially, object classes are nothing else but the implementation of
/// the [official recommendations][whatwg] on using the HTML `class` attribute:
///
/// > […] authors are encouraged to use values that describe the nature of the content,
/// > rather than values that describe the desired presentation of the content.
