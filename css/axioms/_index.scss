/// # Axioms
///
/// Design axioms are the [essential foundation of any viable design system][axioms].
/// Hence, Stylament’s first main layer is called “Axioms”. It consists of the following
/// sub-layers (that, in a way, resemble the first three layers of [ITCSS][itcss]):
///
/// - [Config](ax-config.html)
/// - [Preprocessing Tools](ax-tools.html)
/// - [CSS Custom Properties](ax-properties.html)
/// - [Generic CSS](ax-generic.html)
///
